## Complete Example: Document Management System

This section provides a comprehensive example of how to implement a Document Management system using the ProductBundles platform. This example demonstrates the platform's capabilities including plugin development, scheduling, event handling, and API integration.

### Business Scenario

A legal firm needs to automatically process and categorize incoming documents from multiple sources (email attachments, file uploads, scanned documents). The system should:
- Automatically categorize documents by type (contracts, invoices, legal briefs, correspondence)
- Extract key metadata (client name, date, document type, urgency level)
- Apply retention policies based on document type
- Route documents to appropriate team members
- Maintain audit trails for compliance
